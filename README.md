# Dapr Service Invocation 

In this quickstart, you'll create two microservices that communivate using Dapr's service invocation API. With Daprâ€™s Service Invocation API, your application can communicate reliably and securely with other applications.

# Run and develop locally

### Run the Javascript order-processor service (callee) with Dapr

2. Open a new terminal window, change directories to `./order-processor` in the quickstart directory and run: 

```bash
cd ../order-processor
npm install
```

3. Run the Javascript order-processor service (callee) app with Dapr: 

```bash
dapr run --app-port 5001 --app-id order-processor --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3501 -- npm start
```

### Run the Javascript checkout service (caller) with Dapr

2. Open a new terminal window, change directories to `./checkout` in the quickstart directory and run: 

```bash
cd ../checkout
npm install
```

3. Run the Javascript checkout service (callee) app with Dapr: 

```bash
dapr run  --app-id checkout --app-protocol http --dapr-http-port 3500 -- npm start
```

4. Expected output:
In both terminals, you will see orders passed and orders received. Service invocation requests are made from the checkout service to the order-processor service: 

From the checkout service:
```bash
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":1}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":2}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":3}
== APP == Order passed: {"orderId":4}
```

From the order-processor service:
```bash
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 1 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 2 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 3 }
== APP == Order received: { orderId: 4 }
```

# Deploy to Azure (Azure Container Apps)
Deploy to Azure for dev-test

> NOTE: make sure you have Azure Dev CLI pre-reqs [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-python-mongo-aca)

1. Provision infra and deploy application:
```bash
azd up
```

2. Confirm the deployment is susccessful:

Navigate to the Container App resource for the Batch service. Locate the `Log stream` and confirm the batch container is logging each insert successfully every 10s.
